                <p>Understanding family heritage is important, but often the history of a family is spread between different family members, various documents or family artifacts.
                    Rarely are these separate sources archived correctly or saved in a way that lives on past the members of the family.</p>
                <p>Our family tree app seeks to help users document their family trees, but also store cherished memories of those loved ones.
                    Users will be able to learn about their family heritage, and add what they find is missing.
                    The app will also have a forum to comment on aspects of the family tree.</p>
