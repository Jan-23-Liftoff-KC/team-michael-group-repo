                            THIS IS MY TREE. THERE ARE MANY LIKE IT, BUT THIS ONEâ€™S MINE. MY TREE IS MY BEST FRIEND.
                            IT IS MY LIFE. I MUST MASTER IT AS I MUST MASTER MY LIFE. WITHOUT ME, MY TREE IS USELESS.
                            WITHOUT MY TREE, I AM USELESS. I MUST POPULATE MY TREE WITH PEOPLE TRUE.
                            I MUST BUILD A TREE BETTER THAN MY AUNT GLADYS WHO IS TRYING TO BUILD ONE WITH MISINFORMATION.
                            I MUST PUT HER IN MY TREE BEFORE SHE PUTS ME IN HER TREE. I WILL! BEFORE GOD, I SWEAR THIS CREED.
                            MY TREE AND MYSELF ARE DEFENDERS OF MY HERITAGE. WE ARE THE MASTERS OF OUR ANCESTRY.
                            WE ARE THE SURVIVORS OF MY LIFE. SO BE IT, UNTIL THERE IS NO GLADYS, BUT PEACE. AMEN!
