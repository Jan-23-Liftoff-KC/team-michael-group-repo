# Family Tree LiftOff Project

### Overview
Understanding family heritage is important, but often family history is saved between different family members, various documents, or family artifacts. These separate sources are rarely archived or saved in a way that lives on past members of the family.

We seek to help users document their family trees and store cherished memories of loved ones. Users are able to add family members, details about those family members (including a biography, important dates, and photos), and see how their familly is connected through a family tree interface. The app will soon have a forum to comment on aspects of the family tree.

### Features
- **Family Tree Database and UI**: The site includes an interactive family tree UI connecting all members of the family together.
- **Role Access Management**: Each user of the site will be given a level of access, which will allow them to modify the family tree to different levels.
- **Website Forum**: Users will have a place to discuss recent edits to the family tree.
