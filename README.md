# Family Tree Project Outline

### Overview
Understanding family heritage is important, but often the history of a family is saved between different family members, various documents, or family artifacts. Rarely are these separate sources archived correctly or saved in a way that lives on past the members of the family. 

Our family Tree app seeks to help users document their family trees, but also store cherished memories of those loved ones. Users will be able to learn about their family heritage, and add what see missing. The app will also have a forum to comment on aspects of the family tree.

### Features
- **Family Tree Database and UI**: The site will include a family tree UI connecting all members of the family together.
- **Role Access Management**: Each user of the site will be given a level of access, which will allow them to modify the family tree to different levels.
- **Website Forum**: Users will have a place to discuss recent edits to the family tree.

### Technologies
- Java
- JavaScript
- Spring Boot
- MySQL
- Hibernate
- Thymeleaf templates
- D3

### What I'll Have to Learn
In order to build this app, there are a few new technologies we will need to learn in addition to building on our skills in Java, JavaScript, MySQL, git, and others. One of the new technologies is D3, an API for modifying the document that will display the family tree. We will also need to figure out the best technologies for authentication of users and how to build a forum on the web.
