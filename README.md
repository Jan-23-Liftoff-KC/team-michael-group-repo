# Family Tree LiftOff Project

### Overview
Understanding family heritage is important, but often family history is saved between different family members, various documents, or family artifacts. These separate sources are rarely archived or saved in a way that lives on past members of the family.

We seek to help users document their family trees and store cherished memories of loved ones. Users are able to add family members, details about those family members (including a biography, important dates, and photos), and see how their familly is connected through a family tree interface. The app will soon have a forum to comment on aspects of the family tree.

### Completed Features Demonstration
